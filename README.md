# SINTEZ
SINTEZ Platform of Global Digital Economy

ABOUT SINTEZ

SINTEZ is a revolutionary decentralized blockchain platform of the future economy, combining traditional and innovative mechanisms for building economic relations and modern methods of ensuring security.

Our mission is the synthesis of maximum convenience, safety, quality, efficiency and productivity of the new generation and, as a result, a new level of development of the global digital economy.

Our project is a unique solution that includes 2 key know-how:

1. The digital currency COIN, which is completely decentralized and, by virtue of its technology, always remains as stable and liquid as possible. Intended to be used as money for the exchange of goods or services in day to day situations rather than an asset that can sharply increase or decrease in value in value such as Bitcoin and its relatives. As an investor, you could also view Coin as a stable fund, in other words, if you think Bitcoin is about to take a sharp decline, you could protect your investment with Coin.

2. Smart Investing is a component of SINTEZ, which allows (unlike existing and emerging platforms) to flexibly and accurately identify the needs of the investor and most effectively implement without having to choose the strategies and managers yourself! It also will be interested for traders (private, management companies, funds, banks) to attract capital to management. Smart Investing implies the creation of a market for professional management services.
